Emulates Switch controller. Opens joycontrol.command_line_interface to send button commands and more.

While running the cli, call "help" for an explanation of available commands.

Usage:
    run_controller_cli.py <controller> [--device_id | -d  <bluetooth_adapter_id>]
                                       [--spi_flash <spi_flash_memory_file>]
                                       [--reconnect_bt_addr | -r <console_bluetooth_address>]
                                       [--log | -l <communication_log_file>]
                                       [--nfc <nfc_data_file>]
    run_controller_cli.py -h | --help

Arguments:
    controller      Choose which controller to emulate. Either "JOYCON_R", "JOYCON_L" or "PRO_CONTROLLER"

Options:
    -d --device_id <bluetooth_adapter_id>   ID of the bluetooth adapter. Integer matching the digit in the hci* notation
                                            (e.g. hci0, hci1, ...) or Bluetooth mac address of the adapter in string

    --spi_flash <spi_flash_memory_file>     Memory dump of a real Switch controller. Required for joystick emulation.
                                            Allows displaying of JoyCon colors.
                                            Memory dumps can be created using the dump_spi_flash.py script.

    -r --reconnect_bt_addr <console_bluetooth_address>  Previously connected Switch console Bluetooth address in string
                                                        notation (e.g. "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF") for reconnection.
